# Flask Environment Setup

## Overview
This guide will help you set up a Python Flask environment for local development. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, useful for building web applications and APIs.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed
- Basic **Command-line interface (CLI)** knowledge
- **Text editor or IDE** (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

---

## Step 1: Create a Project Folder
1. Open your command-line interface (CLI).
2. Create a new folder for the Flask project:
   ```bash
   mkdir flask_project
   cd flask_project

---

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment 
Using a virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from system-wide Python packages. The virtual environment provides the isolation needed to manage dependencies effectively across different systems. 

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
To confirm Flask installed correctly, list installed packages:
    ```bash
    pip list ```
